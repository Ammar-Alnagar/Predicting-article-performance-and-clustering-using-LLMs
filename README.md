# Predicting Article Performance and Clustering Using LLMs

Welcome to the Predicting Article Performance and Clustering Using LLMs repository! üì∞üîç This project harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict the performance of articles and perform clustering for content analysis.

## üìú Overview

The Predicting Article Performance and Clustering Using LLMs project applies advanced language models to analyze and predict article performance metrics such as engagement, reach, and relevance. Additionally, it uses clustering techniques to group articles based on content and performance characteristics, providing valuable insights for content strategy and optimization.

## üöÄ Features

- **Performance Prediction:** Predict article performance metrics such as views, likes, shares, and comments using LLMs.
- **Content Clustering:** Group articles into clusters based on their content and performance metrics.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from articles to aid in performance prediction and clustering.
- **Visualization:** Visualize clusters and performance metrics to gain insights into content trends.
- **Documentation and Examples:** Comprehensive documentation and example scripts to help you get started with performance prediction and clustering.

## üì• Installation

To get started with Predicting Article Performance and Clustering Using LLMs, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Predicting-Article-Performance-and-Clustering-using-LLMs.git
   cd Predicting-Article-Performance-and-Clustering-using-LLMs
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Performance Prediction:**
   Use the provided script to predict article performance:
   ```bash
   python predict_performance.py --input path/to/your/articles.csv --output path/to/output/predictions.csv
   ```

4. **Run Clustering Analysis:**
   Use the provided script to perform clustering on article data:
   ```bash
   python cluster_articles.py --input path/to/your/articles.csv --output path/to/output/clusters.csv
   ```
