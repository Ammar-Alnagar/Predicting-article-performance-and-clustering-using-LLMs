# Predicting-article-performance-and-clustering-using-LLMs

Introduction
Predicting-article-performance-and-clustering-using-LLMs is a sophisticated project designed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for predicting the performance of articles and clustering them based on content similarity. This repository combines the power of LLMs with advanced machine learning techniques to analyze article data, forecast engagement metrics, and group similar articles together. Itâ€™s an ideal tool for publishers, content creators, and data scientists interested in optimizing content strategy and understanding audience preferences.

Features
Performance Prediction: Utilize LLMs to predict key performance indicators (KPIs) such as views, shares, and engagement based on article content.
Content Clustering: Automatically cluster articles into groups based on content similarity, enabling better content organization and discovery.
Pre-trained Models: Access pre-trained LLMs optimized for text analysis, ensuring accurate predictions and clustering out-of-the-box.
Customizable Workflows: Flexible pipeline that allows customization of prediction models and clustering algorithms to fit specific needs.
Data Visualization: Built-in tools to visualize clustering results and predicted performance, helping users to make data-driven decisions.
